Thumbs up!! I also recently had a creative workspace installed (featured on the webpage) and the service was impeccable as usual and had a lot of great ideas from the M.INT team. Design, quality of the solution and installation is equally impressive. Highly recommended!"

Both my son and myself really love the blocks so much and we even installed the LED lights with it, which looks very COOL. The workers arrived punctually to install the blocks and everything was completed within 30 mins. Highly recommended."

They made sure that the stools were delivered and were enthusiastic in their replies. They offered to change the colors of cushions when I wanted a different color too. Very happy to be a customer of M.INT. Apart from the top notch service, their stools are really cool and complete the look of my modern themed apartment and I like that they serve as good storage space too. Thank you so much! Would highly recommend."
